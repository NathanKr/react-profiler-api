<h2>Motivation</h2>
Play with react profiler api

<h2>Application</h2>
render a list and button to add item on the end


<h2>profiler callback params. i am using also <a href='https://blog.openreplay.com/the-definitive-guide-to-profiling-react-applications'>this reference</a></h2>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>id</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>the "id" prop of the Profiler tree that has just committed.This is useful for differentiating between different components if youâ€™re profiling more than one at the same time or just for identification purposes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>phase</td>
    <td>"mount" | "update"</td>
    <td>either "mount" (if the tree just mounted) or "update" (if it re-rendered)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>actualDuration</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td> The time spent in milliseconds rendering the Profiler component (The Profiler adds a tiny performance overhead) and all its descendants</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>baseDuration</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>The estimated time in milliseconds that would be spent rendering the descendants without any memoisations. The delta between this and actualDuration should tell you how useful your React.memo and useMemo callls are (for more information about these calls, you can read <a href='https://blog.openreplay.com/improving-react-application-performance-react-memo-vs-usememo'>this article on memoisation in React</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>startTime</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>A timestamp of when React began rendering the current update</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>commitTime</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>A timestamp of when React committed the current update</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>interactions</td>
    <td>Set&lt;SchedulerInteraction&gt;</td>
    <td> A Set of interactions (if any) that were being traced when the update was scheduled</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Points of interests</h2>
<ul>
<li>actualDuration and baseDuration are the most important values</li>
<li>it is insteresting that react is doing better job as more 'Push end' is done thus using the key attribute</li>
</ul>


<h2>Open issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Given react dev tools : why do i need react profiler api</li>
</ul>
